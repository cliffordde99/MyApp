            <p>Welcome to the 21st-century space race, one that could potentially lead to 10-minute space vacations, orbiting space hotels, and humans on Mars. 
               Now, instead of warring superpowers battling for dominance in orbit, private companies are competing to make space travel easier and more affordable. 
               This year, SpaceX achieved a major milestone—launching humans to the International Space Station (ISS) from the United States—but additional goalposts are on the star-studded horizon.
